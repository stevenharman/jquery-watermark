____________________________
Version 3.0 (2009-09-10)
	
	The plugin gets another major version number boost due to significant improvements in areas not covered by any other watermark plugin for jQuery.  Several new features and bug fixes, including everything on the Issue list that could be verified.  (Issue list: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-watermark/issues/list)
	
	Solved Issue #1 - Integrate with WebKit browsers that support input tags with type="search".  (Issue list refers to Safari alone, but it turns out that Google Chrome also supports type="search" elements.)
	
	Solved Issue #4 - Dragging and dropping text now replaces the watermark.  This was the most significant change, and required several work-arounds due to a variety of browser glitches.
	
	Added support for native browser watermarks in WebKit browsers ("placeholder" attribute).  New "useNative" option in the plugin allows native browser watermark support to be enabled/disabled globally, or for individual watermarks.  When a watermark is created, the plugin detects if native browser support is available, and automatically uses it, as long as useNative is true.  Two good reasons to turn *off* native support is the lack of CSS class name support (native watermark/placeholder is always light gray), and native watermarks/placeholders in type="search" elements do not always work properly with drag-and-drop.  (Using the watermark plugin support (useNative:false) for type="search" elements *does* work properly with drag-and-drop.)  However, for typical non-styled watermark usage, native browser support is encouraged, by leaving useNative set to true.  (Default is true).
	
	New "$.watermark.options" object stores the default options for watermarks.  There are currently two properties of $.watermark.options: className and useNative.  (BREAKING CHANGE:  $.watermark.className has been eliminated, and replaced with $.watermark.options.className.)  The use of an object to store default options is is keeping with current jQuery techniques, and allows for future expansion in a much more flexible manner.
	
	New watermark calling signature - $( <selector> ).watermark( [text] , [options] );

	Example: $("#myElement").watermark("Enter Username", {className: "inputspace", useNative: false});
	
	Plugin continues to support the use of a string value for the second argument, for backward compatibility.  If a string value is passed for the second argument, it is used as the className for the watermark, overriding the default value in $.watermark.options.className.
	
	"useNative" option can be either a boolean or a function.  If useNative is a function, then the function is evaluated for each element in the matched set, returning a boolean value specifying if native support is enabled for the element.  The function is passed one argument -- a jQuery object containing the element being tested as the only element in its matched set -- and the DOM element being tested is the object on which the function is invoked (the value of "this").
	
	Worked around jQuery/Chrome bug that would execute $(...).filter(...).each( fn ) twice for each element in the matched set.  (Fairly confident this is a jQuery bug of some type.)
	
	Fixed Chrome bug where password watermarks longer than 10 characters would cause the functionality to fail.
	
	Added $.watermark.version (string value).  Currently set to "3.0".
	
	Changed naming convention of files, removing the version number from the file name and folder name.  In real-world usage, it can be disruptive to try to implement a new version of the plugin if the file name includes the version number.  There are some who feel differently about this issue, and prefer the version number in the file name, but I prefer it removed.  It is easy to add back into the file name, if desired by the individual developer.
	
	KNOWN ISSUES:
		
		Opera support for drag-and-drop is terrible, even with version 10.  It basically supports it when it feels like it.
		
		WebKit native support for watermarks in Search elements (type="search") is poor with drag-and-drop.  Sometimes it works, but it almost never supports dragging between Search elements.  The demo page can be used to try it out and compare the functionality to the plugin's functionality.  With Search elements, you should probably set useNative to false.
		
		WebKit native support does not yet extend to textarea elements.  (Limitation of WebKit browsers.)
	
____________________________
Version 2.0 (2009-06-02)
	
	The plugin gets a major version number boost due to the addition of textarea and password input elements as supported "watermarkable" elements, greatly enhancing the diversity of its usage.  Password element support is good for normal usage, but advanced scenarios such as programmatic changes to the value, should be avoided.
	
	Textarea watermarks can be multi-line by inserting a '\n' sequence at each line break.
	
	Improved IE focus bug fix so that it works for password elements too.
	
	Improved demo page and added new demonstrations for textarea and password input elements.

____________________________
Version 1.1.1 (2009-06-01)
	
	Fixed regression bug in last release that prevented some form submissions.
	
	Fixed focus bug on dynamically-changed watermarks.
	
	Improved demonstration page to test/demonstrate three different form submission methods, using three separate forms on the page. The QueryString can be examined to ensure that no watermarks were posted during form submission.
	
____________________________
Version 1.1 (2009-06-01)
	
	Improved form submission by completely replacing built-in form submit function with our own function that first clears the watermarks, then submits the form.  In previous version programmatic form submission was not triggering the watermark clearing function.
	
	Handles situation where text box's maxLength is less than the length of the watermark string.
	
	Fixed IE bug the hides blinking cursor in some cases.
	
	Improved internal use of jQuery data collection by assigning string constants for key names in one place, rather than replying on hard-coded key names spread throughout the source file.
