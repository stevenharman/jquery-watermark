____________________________
Version 1.1 (2009-06-01)
	
	Improved form submission by completely replacing built-in form submit function with our own function that first clears the watermarks, then submits the form.  In previous version programmatic form submission was not triggering the watermark clearing function.
	
	Handles situation where text box's maxLength is less than the length of the watermark string.
	
	Fixed IE bug the hides blinking cursor in some cases.
	
	Improved internal use of jQuery data collection by assigning string constants for key names in one place, rather than replying on hard-coded key names spread throughout the source file.
	
____________________________
Version 1.0 (2009-05-31)
	
	Initial release.
