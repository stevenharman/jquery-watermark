____________________________
Version 2.x (2009-xx-xx)
	
	Working copy for next version of the plugin.  Will focus on fixing bugs and suggestions on the Issue list.
	
	(TO DO) Issue #1 - Integrate with Safari's input type="search".
	
	(TO DO) Issue #4 - Dragging and dropping text does not replace the watermark.
	
____________________________
Version 2.0 (2009-06-02)
	
	The plugin gets a major version number boost due to the addition of textarea and password input elements as supported "watermarkable" elements, greatly enhancing the diversity of its usage.  Password element support is good for normal usage, but advanced scenarios such as programmatic changes to the value, should be avoided.
	
	Textarea watermarks can be multi-line by inserting a '\n' sequence at each line break.
	
	Improved IE focus bug fix so that it works for password elements too.
	
	Improved demo page and added new demonstrations for textarea and password input elements.

____________________________
Version 1.1.1 (2009-06-01)
	
	Fixed regression bug in last release that prevented some form submissions.
	
	Fixed focus bug on dynamically-changed watermarks.
	
	Improved demonstration page to test/demonstrate three different form submission methods, using three separate forms on the page. The QueryString can be examined to ensure that no watermarks were posted during form submission.
	
____________________________
Version 1.1 (2009-06-01)
	
	Improved form submission by completely replacing built-in form submit function with our own function that first clears the watermarks, then submits the form.  In previous version programmatic form submission was not triggering the watermark clearing function.
	
	Handles situation where text box's maxLength is less than the length of the watermark string.
	
	Fixed IE bug the hides blinking cursor in some cases.
	
	Improved internal use of jQuery data collection by assigning string constants for key names in one place, rather than replying on hard-coded key names spread throughout the source file.
	
____________________________
Version 1.0 (2009-05-31)
	
	Initial release.
